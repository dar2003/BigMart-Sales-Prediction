# BigMart-Sales-Prediction

**Project Overview:**


The project aims to predict sales for different stores in the BigMart chain using machine learning models. The data includes various features like item type, item MRP, outlet size, outlet location, and more. The main goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately forecast sales based on these features.


**Key Concepts:**

**Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.


**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding data distribution, relationships between features, and visualizing key insights.


**Feature Engineering:** Creating new features to improve model performance.


**Model Training:** Using algorithms like Linear Regression and Random Forest to train predictive models.


**Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using metrics like R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).


**Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing model parameters using techniques like Grid Search.


**Model Saving:** Persisting trained models for future predictions.
